# time-scheduler

This is a time scheduler I developed to help ease the pain points of scheduling for small businesses. Enter in your employee's names, availability, number of hours they want to work, and the days they request off. The system creates a profile for the employee. Click the schedule button and a new schedule is created that is optimized based on your employees.
